This is OUR project and you can contribute directly to it.
If you want to create your version, check LICENSE.txt, but if you'd like to add something to this version, continue reading.

If you'd like to create your own command, follow this template:
    def OUR_command_name(arguments, taken):
        print(stuff happening)
        # NO RETURN
this will result in CommieScript like this:
  command_name arguments, taken

you can check the existing code to see how to do stuff, like updating variables.
it'd be nice if you provided some documentation about it as well
You can obviously submit more than a single command, if you made something like the work, endwork, run system.

If you are patient enough, you can also write some documentation about other commands oryou can transform the examples in documentation.
This stuff will be put in the wiki page.

When you have your thing done, send it to me with the pull requests section.
I'll check it and if everything is ok I'll add it in the next release!

You'll be obviously be mentioned in contributors.txt
