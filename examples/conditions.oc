# IMPLEMENTATION OF IF STATEMENTS IN OURCODE
# using goto:
# goto <line> <condition>

our question = 'are you communist? (yes/no)'
strike question
get answer

our good = 'good komrad!'
our bad = 'fuck you blyat!'

goto 14, ;answer == "yes" # when using strings in conditions you have to use " and not the sneaky '
goto 17, 1                # using 1 as condition will obviously cause the goto statement to always take effect

strike good
goto 19, 1
